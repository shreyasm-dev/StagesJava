      <span>Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation (also called the Ideal Rocket Equation) states that:</span>

      <la-tex display='block'>{\Delta}v=v_e\ln{\frac{m_0}{m_f}}</la-tex>

      <span>where</span>

      <ul>
        <li><la-tex>{\Delta}v</la-tex> is the change in velocity (<la-tex>\frac{m}{s}</la-tex>)</li>
        <li><la-tex>v_e</la-tex> is the exhaust velocity (<la-tex>\frac{m}{s}</la-tex>)</li>
        <li><la-tex>m_0</la-tex> is the initial mass (<la-tex>kg</la-tex>)</li>
        <li><la-tex>m_f</la-tex> is the final mass (<la-tex>kg</la-tex>)</li>
      </ul>

      <span>This is equation can also be extended to multiple stages by considering the final mass of a stage to include itself (now without propellant) and the stages above it, and the initial mass of a stage to include just itself and everything else above it.</span>

      <span>
        <la-tex>I_{sp}</la-tex> is a more convenient way to express the exhaust velocity, rather than the raw exhaust velocity.
      </span>

      <la-tex display='block'>v_e=I_{sp}g_0</la-tex>

      <span>where</span>

      <ul>
        <li><la-tex>I_{sp}</la-tex> is the specific impulse (<la-tex>s</la-tex>)</li>
        <li><la-tex>g_0</la-tex> is the standard gravity (constant, approximately <la-tex>9.81</la-tex>) (<la-tex>\frac{m}{s^2}</la-tex>)</li>
      </ul>

      <span>Some engines, such as the NEXT (NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster) electric propulsion engine, have very high specific impulses. This is due to the fact that they produce more thrust per unit of fuel, but do not necessarily produce a lot of thrust, i.e. they do it over a long period of time. An F-1 (<la-tex>7.77</la-tex> meganewtons) produces about <la-tex>32.78</la-tex> million times more thrust than a NEXT engine (<la-tex>237</la-tex> millinewtons), but the NEXT's specific impulse is about <la-tex>13.7</la-tex> times that of the RS-25's. Specific impulse is more a measure of efficiency than raw power or thrust. This is why it is important to note that Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation only works in free space - you cannot apply it to situations with external forces like gravity, such as Earth. The equation also says absolutely nothing about time, i.e. you could have an engine with an extremely high specific impulse that takes a very, very long time to reach max <la-tex>{\Delta}v</la-tex> due to low thrust.</span>

      <span>This app allows you to calculate <la-tex>{\Delta}v</la-tex> both for single-stage and multi-stage rockets. For both types of rockets, you can calculate it in their respective tabs. For multi-stage rockets, you can use the buttons to add or remove stages, and colors are provided to help differentiate between stages when adding or removing. The app offers presets for specific impulse, structural mass, and payload mass to </span>
